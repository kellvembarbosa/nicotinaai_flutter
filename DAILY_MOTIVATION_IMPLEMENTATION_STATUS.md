# Daily Motivation System Implementation Status

## Completed

1. **Edge Functions Development**:
   - ✅ Created `generate-daily-motivation` Edge Function with multi-language support (PT, EN, ES)
   - ✅ Created `claim-motivation-reward` Edge Function with multi-language support (PT, EN, ES)
   - ✅ Successfully deployed both Edge Functions to Supabase project "Nicotina.AI"
   - ✅ Updated all functions to use the correct OpenAI model: "gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18"

2. **Language Support**:
   - ✅ Implemented language detection based on user's `currency_locale` setting
   - ✅ Added language-specific prompts for OpenAI
   - ✅ Added fallback messages in all three languages
   - ✅ Added localized notification titles
   - ✅ Added localized error and success messages

## Pending

1. **Database Schema**:
   - ❌ Create required database tables in Supabase:
     - `user_notifications`
     - `daily_motivation_logs`
     - `user_fcm_tokens`
     - `user_xp_transactions`
   - ❌ Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for these tables
   - ❌ Create the `add_user_xp` function for handling XP rewards

2. **Testing**:
   - ❌ Test the Edge Functions with users of different language settings
   - ❌ Verify OpenAI integration works with the new model
   - ❌ Test reward claiming functionality
   - ❌ Validate notifications are properly stored and displayed

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Database Schema**:
   - Use the Supabase Dashboard to create the required tables manually
   - Apply the SQL migration script in smaller chunks
   - Verify proper table creation and permissions

2. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the Edge Functions after database tables are created
   - Verify language detection is working properly
   - Confirm OpenAI integration with the new model is functioning
   - Test the complete flow from generating motivation to claiming rewards

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update the app to display the motivational messages
   - Add notification handling for daily motivations
   - Implement the UI for claiming XP rewards
   - Test the full flow in the app

4. **Documentation**:
   - Complete technical documentation for the system
   - Document the API endpoints and expected payloads
   - Provide examples for frontend integration

## Implementation Notes

- The multi-language support is based on the user's `currency_locale` setting
- The system will generate messages in Portuguese (default), English, or Spanish
- If the OpenAI API call fails, the system will use predefined fallback messages
- Each motivational message awards 10 XP when viewed by the user
- Edge Functions are already deployed, but will start working properly once the database tables are created
